// Context holds objects whose lifetime is that of the function instance

	// Logger allows submitting information to logger sinks configured in the platform

	// DataBinding holds a map of <data binding name> <data binding object>. For example, if the user
	// configured the function to bind to an Azure Event Hub, it will hold an instance of an Event Hub
	// client. The user can type cast this to the client type

	// WorkerID holds the unique identifier of the worker currently handling the event. It can be used
	// to key into shared datasets to prevent locking

	// UserData is nil by default. This holds information set by the user should he need access to long
	// living data. The lifetime of this pointer is that of the _worker_ and workers can come and go.
	// Treat this like cache - always check if it's nil prior to access and re-populate if necessary

	// FunctionName holds the name of the function currently running
	FunctionName string
